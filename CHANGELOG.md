# DandersFrames Changelog

## [4.3.0] - 2026-04-10

### Improvements

* (Auras) Force-disable Blizzard aura data source ahead of its removal in 12.0.5 — all users now use Direct API mode immediately
* (Auras) Prevent Blizzard aura source from persisting via profile imports — removed from export categories, forced to Direct on import and every login
* (Aura Filters) Add info banner clarifying that Aura Filters only affect Buff Bar and Debuff Bar, with clickable links to related pages
* (Aura Filters) Remove outdated Defensives and Dispel Detection info section
* (Aura Filters) Dispellable filter now uses a toggle switch (Dispellable By Me / All Dispellable) instead of two separate checkboxes
* (Aura Filters) Warning banner when "All Debuffs" is disabled, recommending healers keep it enabled
* (Aura Blacklist) Add notice explaining the blacklist is a curated Blizzard list
* (Aura Blacklist) Add warning icon next to Symbiotic Relationship noting caster-only blacklist limitation
* (Aura Blacklist) Increased warning and notice banner icon sizes for better visibility
* (Boss Debuffs) Add info banner noting Boss Debuffs cannot trigger Dispel Overlays

### New Features

* **Toggle Switch GUI element** — new reusable UI control for mutually exclusive A/B settings, with themed visuals and label highlighting
* **"New" tab badges** — gold "New" text appears on tabs and their parent category for new features, auto-hides once the tab is opened
* **Targeted List** — a new stacked cast-bar display that shows enemy casts targeting party members. Replaces the group-frame Targeted Spells icons that were broken by Blizzard's recent UnitIsUnit hotfix. Party-mode only, with draggable mover, test mode, four style presets, and full appearance controls including font, colors, icon, border, textures, arrow prefix/suffix, self-target color overlay, hide out-of-combat filter, cast-to-channel transitions, interrupted flash, and per-text-element positioning

### Bug Fixes

* (Tooltips) Add tooltip refresh ticker so third-party tooltip addons (e.g. RaiderIO) can respond to modifier key state changes while hovering unit frames
* (Tooltips) Add clean unit token resolver for tooltip SetUnit calls to work around Midnight 12.0 taint propagation from secure frame attributes
* (Absorb Bars) Fix absorb bars showing as floating bars when Attached or Attached+Overflow display mode is selected
* (Aura Designer) Fix indicators sometimes showing wrong settings (wrong font size, icon size, bar colors) — Configure now runs mid-combat so indicators always get correct static settings immediately
* (Aura Designer) Fix duration text using default Blizzard font/size when the cooldown FontString hasn't been created yet at configure time
* (Personal Targeted Spells) Removed the white center-line overlays from the mover frame
* (Targeted Spells) Added `UNIT_SPELLCAST_FAILED_QUIET` to the registered event list — some cancelled casts previously left dangling personal-display icons

## [4.2.9] - 2026-04-10

### Improvements

* (GUI) Modernised all scroll bars across the addon to use the new slim pill-style thumb instead of the default Blizzard scroll bars

### Bug Fixes

* (Dispel Overlay) Fix "All Dispellable" mode not showing the dispel overlay when using the Blizzard aura data source

## [4.2.8] - 2026-04-08

### New Features

* (Profiler) Major rework of the function profiler with new tabs for per-event CPU cost and per-frame OnUpdate handlers
* (Profiler) New columns for peak calls per frame and per-call memory allocation
* (Profiler) Right-click "Print to Chat" now emits a Top 5 summary
* (Profiler) Function coverage expanded from ~30 to ~140 tracked methods

### Performance

* **Major raid performance pass** — total addon CPU down about **62%** and memory churn down about **93%** in a 20-player boss fight. Expect smoother frames during heavy AoE, big pulls, and dispel-heavy fights, especially on older hardware
* (Buff & Debuff Tracking) Rebuilt the core aura system so it does the work once instead of repeating the same scan 6–7 times per update. Around 99% of aura events now use the fast cached path in raid
* (Dispel Highlights) The colored outline around dispellable debuffs is now near-free — its CPU cost dropped by about 95%
* (Absorb Shields) Shield overlays update about twice as fast and no longer create throwaway data on every update
* (Animated Highlights) Marching-ants borders redraw at 30 FPS instead of 60 with no visible difference, cutting their CPU cost to about a third
* (Aura Designer) Custom indicators reuse a pool of entries instead of creating new ones every frame — noticeably lighter at raid scale
* (Aura Designer) Expiring border color animation no longer tears down and rebuilds the entire border on every tick
* (Frame Updates) Small efficiency win across every frame refresh from caching commonly used WoW APIs

### Bug Fixes

* (Profiler) Fix taint errors from the profiler incorrectly wrapping Blizzard's secure compact raid frame handlers. The profiler now only instruments DandersFrames-owned frames

### Technical Notes

For the curious — measured in a 5m 38s raid boss fight (493,901 calls profiled):

* **Total addon CPU:** ~114 ms/sec → ~43 ms/sec (**−62%**)
* **Memory churn (top sources):** ~12 MB/sec → < 1 MB/sec (**−93%**)
* **Aura cache hit rate:** 99.6% (36,204 of 36,360 events skip the full scan)
* **Dispel overlay CPU share:** 16.4% → 0.8% (**−95%**)
* **Absorb update per call:** ~111 µs / ~80 B → 38.4 µs / 0 B (**−65% CPU, zero allocation**)
* **Aura tracking:** Now uses the `UNIT_AURA updateInfo` payload with a shared `DF.AuraCache` keyed by aura instance ID. Both Aura Designer and Dispel overlay read from the same cache instead of re-querying `C_UnitAuras`
* **Aura Designer indicator entries** are pooled (max 64 reused), and instance keys are cached in a two-level lookup table
* **Dispel overlay** caches its layout state and short-circuits `ApplyOverlayLayout` when nothing relevant changed — same pattern was then applied to absorb shields
* **Update.lua** caches `UnitHealth`, `UnitPower`, `InCombatLockdown` and 9 other Unit\* APIs as file-scope locals to skip global lookups in the hot path

## [4.2.7] - 2026-04-07

### New Features

* (Auras) Added `Player Dispellable` and `All Dispellable` debuff filters to Direct API mode

### Improvements

### Improvements

* (Debug Console) Redesigned page with collapsible sections and a wider log viewer
* (Defensive Icon) Now shows multiple big defensives at once and works consistently across both aura source modes

### WoW API Changes

* (Targeted Spells) Group-frame targeted spell icons disabled — a recent WoW change prevents addons from knowing which party member an enemy is targeting. Personal Targeted Spells still works, and a replacement display is in development
* (Auras) Auto-switch to Direct API mode if the upcoming WoW 12.0.5 patch removes the Blizzard aura source. A popup will explain the change if it triggers
* (Aura Designer) Temporarily disabled Symbiotic Relationship target tracking due to a WoW API issue. Restoration Druids will lose this indicator until it can be reworked

### Bug Fixes

* (Dispel Overlay) Fix "All Dispellable" mode not firing when the dispellable debuff was filtered out of the icon display
* (Debug Console) Fix log viewer crashing when certain protected values were logged
* (Auras) Fix a load-time error when Direct API mode was enabled

### Diagnostics

* (Raid Frames) Added logging to help track down the "raid frames jump on roster change" bug. If affected, open `/df console`, enable the **RAIDPOS**, **LAYOUT**, **ROSTER**, and **FRAMESORT** categories, reproduce, then send the log with your bug report.

## [4.2.4] - 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes

* (Click Casting) Fix click casting not working on pinned frames
* (Dispel Overlay) Fix "All Dispellable" mode only showing debuffs the player can personally dispel — now correctly highlights any dispellable debuff (Magic, Curse, Disease, Poison) regardless of class
* (Dispel Overlay) Fix swapped dropdown labels for "All Dispellable" and "Dispellable By Me" options

## [4.2.1] - 2026-04-04

* (Localization) Fix Spanish locale file containing a CurseForge API error instead of translation data

## [4.2.0] - 2026-04-04

### New Features

* (Resource Bar) Add "Use Class Color" option for resource bars — colors power bars by class instead of power type (thanks **sKullsen**)
* (Localization) Add full localization infrastructure using AceLocale-3.0 and CurseForge translation system — community translators can now contribute translations via the CurseForge web UI without touching code
* (Localization) Add locale stubs for 11 languages: English, German, Spanish (EU/LATAM), French, Italian, Korean, Portuguese (BR), Russian, Chinese (Simplified/Traditional)

### Improvements

### Bug Fixes

* (Auras) Fix auras not showing after switching profiles with different data source settings
* (Aura Designer) Fix indicator icons blocking click-casting in combat

## [4.1.8] - 2026-03-26

### New Features

* (Auras) Add Aura Filter Setup Wizard — guided setup to help configure aura data source and filter options. Runs automatically on first login after update, or manually via the Aura Filters settings tab

## [4.1.7] - 2026-03-25

### Bug Fixes

* (Auras) Fix Blizzard data source showing no debuffs — Blizzard moved aura data from frame arrays to container objects in the latest update, updated reader to use new Iterate API

## [4.1.6] - 2026-03-25

### Bug Fixes

* (Growth) Fix nil wrap error when growth direction value has no underscore separator
* (Growth) Add safety fallback for nil wrap in growth direction composer

## [4.1.5] - 2026-03-24

### Bug Fixes

* (Grouped Raids) Fix hidden groups sometimes showing frames when players join or are moved into them — hidden group headers are now fully neutralized (attributes cleared) so they can never claim or display units
* (Boss Debuffs) Fix private auras showing on wrong players after sorting or roster changes — restore reanchor system with combat lockdown guards so anchors rebind to the correct unit token
* (Targeted Spells) Stagger icon pool creation for raid frames to prevent script-ran-too-long errors when 40 frames initialise simultaneously

* (Auras) Add issecretvalue local cache to Icons.lua and DebugAuras.lua

## [4.1.4] - 2026-03-23

### New Features

* **Frame Scale** — new slider in Layout settings to scale party and raid frames (0.5x–2.0x). Movers, snap-to-grid, and drag all work correctly at any scale. Scale is per-profile and applies to containers, movers, and test frames.
* (Pinned Frames) **Auto-Update by Role** — when auto-add role filters are active (tanks, healers, DPS), players whose role no longer matches are automatically removed. Manually added players and offline players are never auto-removed.

### Bug Fixes

* (Grouped Raids) Fix empty groups overlapping populated groups — empty groups were being positioned at their natural grid slot instead of being skipped, causing overlap when groups compact
* (Grouped Raids) Fix groups sometimes overlapping on roster change — position handler now re-fires on every roster update to stay in sync with WoW's internal child re-sorting
* (Flat Raids) Fix raid anchor moving when respeccing or dying — grouped-mode positioning was resizing the shared container when flat mode was active
* (Flat Raids) Fix frames overlapping with grouped headers when auto layout switches from grouped to flat mode
* (Pinned Frames) Fix frames drifting towards bottom-left when changing scale
* (Pinned Frames) Fix drag speed mismatch at non-1.0 scale — frames now track the cursor 1:1 at any scale

## [4.1.3] - 2026-03-17

### New Features

* (Aura Designer) **Show When Missing** — per-indicator toggle that inverts visibility: shows the indicator when the aura is absent, hides when present. Supports all indicator types except bars. Icons support a "Desaturate When Missing" sub-option.
* (Aura Designer) **Show When Missing + Expiring** — when both are enabled, the indicator stays hidden while the buff is active, appears during the expiring window, then shows with normal appearance once the buff drops off
* (Auras) **Growth Direction Control** — replaced the single growth dropdown with a three-part control (Orientation, Wrap, Direction) for clearer configuration
* (Aura Designer) **Sound Alerts** — per-indicator sound alerts that play when an aura appears, expires, or is missing. Supports all LibSharedMedia sounds, adjustable volume, loop/one-shot modes, and a global "Mute All Sound Alerts" toggle in the Aura Designer banner. Includes a searchable sound dropdown picker.
* (Sorting) **[Experimental] FrameSort Addon Integration** — added support for the FrameSort addon. When enabled in General > Sorting, FrameSort controls frame ordering for party, raid (flat and grouped), and arena frames. Requires the FrameSort addon to be installed separately.

### Bug Fixes

* (Raid Frames) **Major fix** for raid frames jumping/shifting position when players join, leave, or when loading into LFR/BGs — completely reworked the reposition pipeline to batch all updates into a single authoritative reposition, with a settling debounce for instance loading
* (Flat Raid Frames) Fixed flat raid frames flickering between party and raid settings during group transitions
* (Flat Raid Frames) Fixed flat raid frame positioning breaking after layout or roster changes
* (Position) Fixed mover handles for both party and raid staying visible after switching group type
* (Auto Layouts) Fixed several issues with switching between flat and grouped layouts — duplicate frames, hidden groups reappearing after combat, and layout not updating after mid-fight settings changes
* (Aura Designer) Fixed grouped layout preview not rendering correctly after the growth direction overhaul — indicators were stacking on top of each other instead of spreading out
* (Aura Designer) Fixed custom border indicators not showing on the frame preview
* (Aura Designer) Fixed indicators appearing on disabled pinned frames
* (Aura Designer) Fixed several Show When Missing visual issues — out-of-range alpha, transparent frames, stale duration text, pulsate animation not stopping, and indicators not appearing in test mode
* (Sound Alerts) Fixed sound engine not finding raid frames when using flat layout
* (Sound Alerts) Sound-only auras now correctly tracked for buff bar dedup
* (Sorting) Fixed secret string taint in cross-realm name caching

### Improvements

* (Debug Console) Added comprehensive debug logging across roster updates, header visibility, flat raid operations, frame positioning, and frame layout — helps diagnose frame issues in the field

## [4.1.2] - 2026-03-16

### New Features

* (Health Text) **Hide % Symbol** — new checkbox to remove the percent sign from health percentage text
* (Pinned Frames) **Growth direction anchoring** — Frame Growth and Column Growth now support Start, Center, and End options, controlling which edge stays fixed as frames are added (e.g. "Start" grows rightward/downward, "End" grows leftward/upward)
* (Pinned Frames) **Reset Position button** — resets a pinned frame set to the center of the screen if it gets lost off-screen

> **Note:** Pinned frame positions may have shifted slightly due to the new anchoring system. Use the Reset Position button or reposition frames if needed.

### Bug Fixes

* (Auras) Fixed buff/debuff borders staying visible even when disabled — operator precedence bug caused the buff border check to fire regardless of aura type
* (Aura Designer) Fixed stack count text bleeding onto adjacent icons when auras reorder in a layout group
* (Defensive Icons) Fixed 2nd+ defensive bar icons always showing tooltip and ignoring tooltip settings, anchor position, and click-through configuration
* (Resource Bar) Fixed resource bar being 2px too wide when "Match Width" is enabled and a frame border is active
* (Status Icons) Fixed leader icon not hiding in combat when "Hide in Combat" is enabled
* (Pinned Frames) Fixed error when OnDragStop fires without a matching OnDragStart on pinned frame movers

## [4.1.1] - 2026-03-15

### Bug Fixes

* (Position) Lowered permanent mover frame strata from HIGH to MEDIUM so it no longer covers other UI elements
* (Defensive Icons) Fixed double-scaled positioning offsets causing defensive icons to stack vertically instead of horizontally
* (Defensive Icons) Reduced raid frame defensive icon defaults (size 20, scale 1.0, max 3) to fit narrower raid frames
* (Pinned Frames) Fixed aura designer indicators (borders, defensives, dispels) leaking onto disabled pinned frame sets
* (Aura Designer) Fixed border indicator pandemic state using the regular border alpha instead of the configured expiring alpha
* (Aura Designer) Declassified Beacon of Virtue as non-secret — spell ID 200025 is on Blizzard's whitelist and readable via standard API

## [4.1.0] - 2026-03-14

### New Features

* (Position) **Permanent Mover handle** — a small always-visible drag handle on frames for repositioning without unlocking, with customizable position, size, offset, colors, show-on-hover with fade animation, hide-in-combat option, and red combat indicator
* (Position) **Permanent Mover quick actions** — left-click, right-click, shift+left-click, and shift+right-click can be bound to 13 preset actions including open settings, quick switch profile/click-cast profile, cycle profiles, toggle test mode, unlock frames, toggle solo mode, ready check, pull timer, reset position, and reload UI
* (Position) **Permanent Mover attach to unit** — handle can be attached to the container, first visible unit, or last visible unit so it follows the group size
* (Position) **Hide drag overlay** checkbox in the unlock panel to hide the blue drag area while keeping frames draggable
* (Dispel Overlay) **Color Name Text** — optional checkbox to color the unit's name text with the dispel type color when a dispellable debuff is present

* (Aura Designer) **Expiring whole alpha pulse** — entire icon/square pulses its alpha when expiring
* (Aura Designer) **Expiring bounce animation** — icon/square bounces up and down when expiring
* (Aura Designer) **Hide duration text above threshold** — duration text can be hidden when the remaining time is above a configurable seconds threshold (icon, square, and bar types)
* (Aura Designer) **Expiring threshold in seconds** — expiring indicators can now trigger based on remaining seconds as well as remaining percentage
* (Aura Designer) **Trigger operator (ANY / ALL)** — indicators with multiple trigger spells can now require all triggers to be active (AND mode) or just one (OR mode, default)
* (Aura Designer) **Duration priority (Highest / Lowest)** — expiring indicators on multi-trigger spells can track the highest or lowest remaining duration buff
* (Aura Designer) **Custom border mode** — border indicators can now use an independent overlay per aura, so multiple border indicators can be visible at the same time
* (Aura Designer) **Settings grouped in containers** — all indicator settings panels and global defaults are now organized with bordered section containers
* (Aura Designer) **Earthliving Weapon** added as a trackable Restoration Shaman aura
* (Aura Designer) **Sense Power** added as a trackable Augmentation Evoker secret aura
* (Aura Designer) **Ebon Might self-buff tracking** — Augmentation Evoker's caster self-buff (395296) is now tracked on the player via fingerprint disambiguation, with correct tooltip and buff bar dedup
* (Aura Designer) **Symbiotic Relationship linked aura system** — Restoration Druid's caster buff is detected on the player and mirrored as an indicator onto the target's frame, with OOC target resolution, tooltip-based fallback, recast detection, and buff bar dedup

* (Debug) **Script Runner** — multiline Lua script input in the debug console with persistent text across sessions

### Bug Fixes

* (Position) Fixed nudge buttons causing the blue drag area to vanish
* (Auras) **Fixed taint errors from secret value comparisons** — duration hide, expiring indicators, and color curves now correctly pipe secret values through secret-aware APIs only

## [4.0.16] - 2026-03-11

### Bug Fixes

* (Click Casting) **Fixed binding tooltip vanishing when pressing modifier keys** — modifier format mismatch caused all bindings to be filtered out

* (Fading) **Fixed name and health text alpha resetting to 1.0** on zone change, combat res, vehicle exit, and test mode exit
* (Aura Designer) **Fixed secret auras not appearing immediately on cast in combat** — inline fingerprint matching eliminates race condition between detection and rendering
* (Aura Designer) Fixed Verdant Embrace tooltip incorrectly showing Upheaval

### New Features

* (Aura Designer) **Secret aura tracking** — tracks auras that WoW hides behind secret spell IDs using signature-based fingerprinting (credit to Harrek for the technique and aura data from Advanced Raid Frames)
* (Aura Blacklist) **Combat / out-of-combat controls** — per-spell checkboxes to blacklist auras only in combat, only out of combat, or both

## [4.0.13] - 2026-03-08

## [4.0.12] - 2026-03-06

### New Features

* **Layout groups** (Aura Designer) — group placed indicators at a shared anchor with automatic flow positioning; when an aura is inactive, grouped indicators collapse without gaps
* **Spec-scoped aura configs** (Aura Designer) — configurations are now saved per-spec, so shared buffs like Prayer of Mending can have different indicator setups on each spec
* **Preview click-to-select** (Aura Designer) — left-click any indicator on the frame preview to jump to its settings; right-click to remove it
* **Duration and Stack text color** (Aura Designer) — new color pickers with alpha for duration text and stack text on icon and square indicators, available as both global defaults and per-indicator overrides
* **Hide Icon (Text Only)** (Aura Designer) — new checkbox on icon and square indicators that hides the icon visual while keeping duration and stack text visible
* **Cancel Targeting option** (Click Casting) — new per-binding checkbox in advanced settings that adds /stopspelltarget to the macro, preventing the blue targeting hand on certain spells. Disabled by default so spells like Rescue work correctly

### Bug Fixes

### New Features

* **Direct API buff filters** — added Not Cancelable, Big Defensives, and External Defensives as toggleable filter options
* **Additive filter logic** — enabled filters now use OR logic so selecting multiple categories shows the union (e.g. Raid In Combat + Big Defensives shows both) instead of requiring auras to match all selected filters
* **Defensive icon scanning** — defensive icon now detects both Big Defensives and External Defensives (e.g. Pain Suppression, Blessing of Sacrifice)
* **Filter tooltips** — hover any filter checkbox to see a description of what that category includes
* **Defensive bar spacing** — icon spacing slider now supports negative values for overlapping icons
* **Updated filter defaults** — buff filters default to Raid In Combat + Big Defensives + External Defensives; debuff filters default to Raid Debuffs + Crowd Control + Important Spells (migrated for existing users)

## [4.0.8] - 2026-03-01

### New: Aura Designer

Visual indicator system for tracking buffs, debuffs, and auras on your frames.
* **8 indicator types** — 3 placed indicators (Icon, Square, Bar) that occupy anchor points on the frame, plus 5 frame effects (Border, Health Bar Color, Name Text Color, Health Text Color, Frame Alpha) that affect the entire frame
* **Drag-to-place** — drag auras from the spell list onto any of 9 anchor points (corners, edges, center) with X/Y offset adjustment
* **Icon indicators** — spell icon with cooldown swipe, duration text, and stack count display
* **Square indicators** — colored square with cooldown swipe, duration text, and stack count
* **Bar indicators** — progress bar showing remaining duration with horizontal/vertical orientation, match-frame-width option, fill color, background color, and bar-color-by-time gradient
* **Border frame effect** — 5 styles: Solid, Animated, Dashed, Glow, and Corners Only with configurable thickness and color
* **Health Bar Color frame effect** — Replace or Tint mode with adjustable blend strength
* **Name/Health Text Color frame effects** — override unit name or health text color when an aura is active
* **Frame Alpha frame effect** — adjust entire frame transparency based on aura presence
* **Expiring system** — all 8 indicator types support an expiring color that activates below a configurable remaining-duration threshold, fully combat-safe
* **Priority stacking** — configurable priority per aura (1-20); frame effects only show the highest-priority active aura, placed indicators coexist on separate anchors
* **Buff coexistence** — standard buff icons can display alongside Aura Designer indicators, with a popup to choose when enabling AD
* **Global defaults** — configure default icon size, scale, duration/stack font, font scale, and outline style; new indicators inherit these automatically with per-indicator overrides available
* **Live preview** — indicators render on the frame preview in the options panel with adjustable zoom (0.75×–2.5×)
* **Per-spec aura lists** — curated aura lists for 8 healer and augmentation specs, auto-refreshes when switching specs

### New: Auto Layouts (Raid Only)

Automatically switches your raid frame layout based on content type and raid size. Does not apply to party, solo, or arena.
* **Three content categories** — Instanced/PvP (raids, dungeons, battlegrounds), Mythic (fixed 20-player), and Open World (world bosses, outdoor groups)
* **Per-size-range profiles** — create multiple layouts per content type, each covering a custom player range (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, 21-40). Mythic is a single fixed layout for 20 players
* **Automatic switching** — monitors group roster, zone changes, and instance type; applies the matching layout on-the-fly when content or raid size changes
* **Override-only storage** — each layout stores only the settings that differ from your global profile; everything else is inherited automatically
* **Full settings coverage** — overrides can include frame size, growth direction, groups per row, group visibility, bar colors, text settings, aura filters, icon toggles, pinned frame configuration, and more
* **Live editing** — click "Edit Settings" to enter editing mode with live frame preview; every change is tracked as an override with visual indicators showing which settings are modified vs global
* **Override indicators** — green checkmark for global values, orange star with reset button for modified values, per-tab override counts
* **Non-destructive** — your global profile is never modified; exiting editing mode restores your base settings cleanly
* **Crash recovery** — if editing is interrupted, the next login detects and restores your base settings
* **Status display** — shows current content type, instance name, raid size, active layout, and override count
* **Export/import support** — auto layout configurations included in profile exports

### New: Aura System Improvements

* **Direct Aura mode** — optional mode that gives full control over which buffs and debuffs appear using filter categories (Player, Raid, Big Defensive, etc.). Configure in Auras > Aura Filters
* **All Buffs / All Debuffs toggles** — master toggles to quickly show all buffs or all debuffs without configuring individual filters
* **Important Spells filter** — checkbox to show Blizzard's curated list of important buffs and debuffs
* **Buff deduplication** — buffs already displayed by the Defensive Bar or Aura Designer are automatically hidden from the buff bar. Enabled by default, toggle in Buffs tab
* **Multi-defensive icons** — Defensive Bar now shows all active big defensives simultaneously (up to configured max), not just one
* **Defensive bar compound growth** — growth direction now supports two-axis layouts (e.g., RIGHT_DOWN, LEFT_UP) with configurable wrap count
* Max buff and debuff icon count increased from 5 to 8

### New Features
